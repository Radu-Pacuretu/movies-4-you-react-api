## What is movies4you?

movies4you is a personal project to put in practice various Web Development concepts. This is an Express router and provides the backend integration for the project, I also have a sister project that is the frontend part of the project and uses the React library.

## What can it do?

You can use movies4you to search [themoviedb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) database for movies that might be of interest, you can see details about the movies, rate them and add them to a watch list.

The backend is meant to be a proxy between the user interface and the DB in order to abstract the DB APIs and provide additional control and security.

## How can I contribute

Any feedback is more than welcome be it by email or by Pull Request but this is more of a test project for new concepts that I learn. I will keep adding features to it, maybe in the future it will have some use and I will publish it.
